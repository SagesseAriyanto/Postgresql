SQLite vs PostgreSQL: What You Need to Know
===========================================

SQLite
------
- SQLite is a file-based database. All your data is stored in a single file (e.g., instance/users.db).
- Strength: Easy to set up, great for development and debugging. You can open the file with a DB viewer and inspect your data.
- Weakness: Not suitable for production hosting. On platforms like Heroku or Render, the file location can change or be wiped every 24 hours, causing data loss.
- Use SQLite for local development and testing only.

PostgreSQL
----------
- PostgreSQL is a powerful, server-based relational database. It can handle millions of records and is reliable for production use.
- Data is stored on a managed server, not in a local file. This means your data is safe and persistent.
- Most hosting providers (Heroku, Render, etc.) recommend PostgreSQL for production apps.

PostgreSQL and psycopg
----------------------
- PostgreSQL is a database system, like SQLite, but designed for reliability, scalability, and multi-user access.
- You can interact with PostgreSQL using SQL commands, just like SQLite.
- The main difference: PostgreSQL stores data on a server (local or remote), while SQLite stores data in a local file.
- The 'psycopg' package is a database adapter (driver) that lets your Python app connect to PostgreSQL servers and execute SQL commands.
- SQLAlchemy is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) that lets you write Python code to interact with databases, and it generates SQL queries for you.
- When you use SQLAlchemy with psycopg, SQLAlchemy builds the SQL commands and psycopg sends those commands to the PostgreSQL server and returns results.
- You can switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL by just changing the database URI—no need to change your code if you use SQLAlchemy.

Why Companies Pay for Managed Databases
---------------------------------------
- Companies pay cloud providers (like AWS, Heroku, Render) to host databases because:
  - They want reliable, secure, and scalable data storage.
  - Providers handle backups, updates, and hardware failures.
  - Data is always available to users, even if traffic increases.
- For experiments and learning, SQLite is fine. For real apps and businesses, managed databases like PostgreSQL are essential.

Summary
-------
- Use SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production.
- Update your database URI and requirements.txt for deployment.
- SQLAlchemy and psycopg make switching databases seamless.
- SQLite: simple, file-based, good for development.
- PostgreSQL: server-based, reliable, good for production.
- SQLAlchemy: generates SQL from Python code.
- psycopg: connects Python to PostgreSQL and executes SQL.
- Companies pay for managed databases to ensure data safety and reliability for their users.
